# 📊 PMP/CAPM Capstone Project: [Project Title Here]

## 🧩 Overview
This repository showcases my Capstone project completed as part of the PMP/CAPM certification training. It demonstrates hands-on application of **Agile and Waterfall methodologies**, with a strong emphasis on **stakeholder communication** and **risk management**.

As a **Scrum Inc. Registered Product Owner** and **Certified Scrum Master**, I structured this project to simulate real-world scenarios using best practices from both traditional and Agile frameworks.

## 🚀 Project Objectives
- Apply project management knowledge using both Agile and Waterfall approaches.
- Engage stakeholders with structured communication and feedback loops.
- Develop and maintain a risk management framework.
- Deliver comprehensive documentation and reports for each phase of the project lifecycle.
